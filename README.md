# USA_ZIP_CODES
I used this script to download all GeoJSON data for all available USA ZIP codes in unitedstateszipcodes.org.
The script is ready to work with python3.

The script will do the following:
1-Automatically create a file called 'allzipdatawithstate.csv' where all ZIP codes of USA will be available
2-Create a directory named 'JSONs' and download all the files to it.

How to run:

- In terminal cd to where you downloaded the file.
- chmod +x start.py
- ./start.py
